## Prerequisites
- A USB drive, preferably 8gb or larger, for the modded recovery image.

## Section I - Downloading a Recovery image

First things first, you need to grab a recovery image lower than v125 for your board.

- https://chrome100.dev

## Section II - Mod the Recovery image

Vist the [BadRecovery Web Bulider](https://binbashbanana.github.io/badrecovery) and upload the RAW recovery image. choose auto and wait a couple of minute and it should download automatically.

## Section III - Flashing the image

Did it download automatically? Amazing! Please follow the next instructions for
flashing.

### Across all platforms (ChromeOS, Mac, Windows, Linux, etc.)

If you are using a Chromium browser, Download the Chromebook Recovery Utility and click on "Use Local Image" on the dropdown menu.

Select your modded recovery image you made earlier and click Continue.

WARNING: All data on this USB will be lost. Consider making a backup of the USB
if this is the only one laying around you.
{: .notice--danger}

Once done, you should plug the USB into your chromebook and hit ESC+REFRESH+POWER.
Recovery should now start. Sit back and relax until the BadRecovery screen pops up.

### Linux

Run
```dd if=/path/to/yourmoddedrecoimage.bin of=/dev/sdWHATEVERYOURUSBIS```

MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT FLASHING TO YOUR INTERNAL DISK! DOING SO WILL
RESULT IN LOSS OF DATA!
{: .notice--danger}

If all goes well, the command will finish with no errors.
A 0 exit code is not a error, please ignore that.

### Windows
Download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie), run the exe and select the raw image. Choose DD mode if prompted. Click START to Continue.

### MacOS
Download [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) and run the executable/appimage. Click allow for everything. Select the modded reco image and your USB drive.

## Section IV - Booting BadRecovery

Unlike SH1MMER, DO NOT enter devmode unless you have a ancient board (pre-CR50).

Instead simply press ESC+REFRESH+POWER and plug in your USB.

The recovery process should start.

After a while you should get kicked to a BadRecovery screen. Let it remove
FWMP and enable dev mode. If it shows a error of tpmc failing to remove FWMP, your chromebook is incompatible to the exploit. (This issue is not really common anymore since the latest version patched this.)

Now press Refresh and Power.

Please note that your admin can see that your device is offline. If you are not allowed to do this, set your kernver to 0 and reenroll using KVS.
{: .notice--danger}

## Section VI- Postmodem

If you want to reenroll but want to unenroll at anytime, continue to [kvs](kvs)
{: .notice--success}

If you want to run things like linux on your chromebook, consult the chrultrabook wiki.

...or you can just use it like a normal chromebook and run things like Crostini. The choices are endless.
