## Get started

Seriously, how did you run into an issue *here*? Make an issue on the GitHub repo for more help.

## Downgrading (Any Version)

### Help! I don't have a personal computer with admin permissions and the Chromebook Recovery Utility extension is blocked!

Either get a friend to help you or else you're out of luck. Sorry, skid.

### I don't have a USB drive, can you send one to me?

Go out and buy one. While you're at it, touch some grass.

### My USB drive is less than 8gb. Will it still work?

Yes. Use SH1MMER legacy instead.

### Recovery outputs something about the drive being outdated

This means that, at some point, you've updated to v112 or higher. Use BadRecovery if under 125.

## Root Escalation (>v101)

### No red prompt appears after running the root exploit

Womp Womp. Recover again. Try again. Do better next time.

### `set_cellular_ppp` outputs "No Cellular Service Exists"

Either you're on a version where the `set_cellular_ppp` bug is patched (v101 or higher) or something else got messed up. Try downgrading again.

## Root Escalation (v81 - Kiosk)

### I can't find my USB drive to load CHRWN from

Reboot. Try again.

## Sh1mmer

### "This USB drive does not contain ChromeOS" upon trying to boot the shim

Either you've upgraded past v112 (at which point sh1mmer is patched) or you downloaded the shim for the wrong board.


### When I do SH1MMER, it says im using a unoffical image.

HOW. HOW DO YOU CONFUSE A RECOVERY IMAGE WITH A SHIM???? WHY..

..speaking of which, you should've read the instructions for SH1MMER.

## LtBEEF

### The script isn't running on any page.

Either the site that LtBEEF is being loaded from is blocked, in which case you're on a version where LtBEEF is patched, or you're on the wrong page. Keep in mind that LtBEEF needs to be run on:

`https://chrome.google.com/webstorex`.

## Murkmod

### Installing/Updating error: Read-only Filesystem

Try recovering, unenrolling, then fakemurking and murkmodding again.

## Depthboot

Troubleshooting for Depthboot coming soon.

## cedr
