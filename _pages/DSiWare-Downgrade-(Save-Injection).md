If you are between versions 11.0.0 and 11.2.0, you must follow this guide to downgrade your NATIVE_FIRM using DSiWare
{: .notice}

This takes advantage of an oversight which allows DSiWare titles to read and write anywhere in NAND.
{: .notice--info}

Be prepared to wait 20 minutes (New 3DS) to an hour (Old 3DS). Slowhax (waithax) is named so for a reason.
{: .notice--info}

This is a currently working implementation of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws).
{: .notice--info}

Your DSiWare's save will be backed up before getting replaced by the hacked save.
